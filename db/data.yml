    - South India Travel Doc - Part 01
    - "South India is the area encompassing India's states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu as well as the union territories of Lakshadweep and Pondicherry, occupying 19.31% of area. South India lies in the peninsular Deccan Plateau and is bounded by the Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal in the west, south and east respectively. The geography of the region is diverse, encompassing two mountain ranges \x97 the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats and a plateau heartland. Godavari, Krishna, Tungabhadra and Kaveri rivers are important non-perennial sources of water. Inhabitants of South India are referred to as South Indians. A majority of South Indians speak one of the five Dravidian languages \x97 Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu and Tulu. During its history, a number of dynastic kingdoms ruled over parts of South India whose invasions across southern and southeastern Asia impacted the history and cultures of modern nation-states such as Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. The region was colonised by Britain and gradually incorporated into the British Empire.\n\
      After experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after Indian independence, the economies of South Indian states have registered higher than national average decadal growth over the past three decades. While South Indian states have improved in some socio-economic metrices, economic disparity, illiteracy and poverty continue to affect the region much like the rest of the country. Agriculture is the single largest contributor to the regional net domestic product, while Information technology (IT) is a rapidly growing industry. Literary and architectural styles, evolved over two thousand years, differ from other parts of the country. Politics in southern India is dominated by smaller regional political parties rather than by national political parties.\n\
      South India ranks the highest in terms of social and economic development in areas such as fertility rate and infrastructure; the fertility rate of South India is 1.9, the lowest of all regions in India.\n\n\

    - Jaisalmer - Part I
    - |-
      Imagine you travel through a dry and waste land like the Thar desert during summertime and a temperature of 46 degrees Celsius and more......and suddenly a true oasis arises on the horizont with a huge fortress on a mountain! It is like a mirracle!
      That was my first impression of Jaisalmer. 
      An oasis in the middle of nowhere! 
      Jaisalmer is a sleepy place in the middle of nowhere, close to the Pakistani border right in the desert. Maybe this isolation is the reason why this magnificent place kept preserved like back in its hey-days. Yes, the fort on the hill is completely intact like back in the days. There only exist the old sandstone buildings, temples and the palace, protected by huge walls and strong gates. It is like going back with a time machine!
      There are plenty of possibilities to stay right inside the fort, with beautiful balconies and a great view over the desert. Stroll around through the narrow alleys with its beautifully decorated sandstone buildings! It is pure history!

    - WORLD TRAVEL - INCREDIBLE INDIA
    - "India ( /??ndi?/), officially the Republic of India (Hindi: ???? ??????? Bh?rat Ga?ar?jya; see also official names of India), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by geographical area, the second-most populous country with over 1.18 billion people, and the most populous democracy in the world.[16][17] Mainland India is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the west, and the Bay of Bengal on the east; and it is bordered by Pakistan to the west;[note] Bhutan, the People's Republic of China and Nepal to the north; and Bangladesh and Burma to the east. In the Indian Ocean, mainland India and the Lakshadweep Islands are in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, while India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share maritime border with Thailand and the Indonesian island of Sumatra in the Andaman Sea.[18] India has a coastline of 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi).[19]\r\n\
      Home to the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation and a region of historic trade routes and vast empires, the Indian subcontinent was identified with its commercial and cultural wealth for much of its long history.[20] Four of the world's major religions\x97Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism\x97originated here, while Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam arrived in the first millennium CE and shaped the region's diverse culture. Gradually annexed by the British East India Company from the early eighteenth century and colonised by the United Kingdom from the mid-nineteenth century, India became an independent nation in 1947 after a struggle for independence that was marked by widespread non-violent resistance led by Mahatma Gandhi.[21]\r\n\
      India is a federal constitutional republic with a parliamentary democracy consisting of 28 states and seven union territories. A pluralistic, multilingual and multiethnic society, India is also home to a diversity of wildlife in a variety of protected habitats. The Indian economy is the world's eleventh largest economy by nominal GDP and the fourth largest by purchasing power parity. Since the introduction of market-based economic reforms in 1991, India has become one of the fastest growing major economies in the world;[22] however, the country continues to face several poverty, illiteracy, corruption and public health related challenges. India is classified as a newly industrialised country[23][24] and is one of the four BRIC nations. It is a nuclear weapons state and has the third-largest standing armed force in the world,[25] while its military expenditure ranks tenth in the world. It is a founding member of the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, the East Asia Summit and the G20 industrial nations, and a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the G8+5.\r\n\

    - Jaisalmer Desert Festival 2010-Louise and Stuart's Amazing India Travels
    - |-
      Louise and I, Stuart, are honored by being asked to officially open the 2010 Jaisalmer Desert Festival.......
      
      A three-day long extravaganza of dances, music, handicraft fairs and interesting competitions- including really unusual ones like a 'Mr Desert' pageant, a 'turban-tying' contest and a `best moustache' contest- the Jaisalmer Desert Festival is organised by the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation. It's a fantastic showcase of all things Rajasthani, and is justifiably popular with tourists, both Indian and foreign. Besides the food, the music and the cultural performances, there are camel rides, processions, camel polo, and even a camel tug-of-war. All of it is held against the backdrop of the awesome Jaisalmer fort. Fireworks displays at night light up the area, and the fort is illuminated too.

      Adithya is a seven year old intelligent boy. He has a sister named Laxmi and his parents are Shankar Rao and Parvathi. Adithya's family lives in a village called Ramapuram. Adithya spends his time playing with friends and roaming here and there in the village.
      
      Adithya's maternal uncle Vishwanadham, who lives in a city, is a well to do businessman. His wife is Shantha and Rangayya is their servant. The three of them live in city in a big bungalow. Vishwanadham, who is childless gets impressed by his nephew Adithya's intelligence, decides to get him educated in city. Vishwanadham convinces his sister and brings Adithya along with him to city. There is one more reason for Vishwanadham to do this. When he was facing dire financial crisis, Adithya's father Shankar Rao has helped him out with money by selling off his fields. With that money, Vishwanadham started several businesses and have become a rich man. Out of gratitude towards Shankar Rao, Vishwanadham wants to repay the favor by providing good education to Adithya and bringing him up in to an able man. Shantha doesn't like this and consults her brother Nagaraju. He tells her to harass Adithya, so that he leaves the city on his own. Shantha follows Nagaraju's advice and allots the store room in her house for Adithya to stay. She is always on the look out to harm Adithya, but gets herself affected every time. 
      Adithya starts feeling lonesome in the house and then a strange parrot becomes his friend. Vishwanadham gets Adithya admitted in a good school. There in the school, is a mischievous boy Veerendra, whom everyone calls as Veeru. Since Adithya has come from a village, Veeru and his friends start teasing him all the time. In this way, Adithya faces harassment in school as well as in the house. 
      
      Elsewhere, sorcerer Aghora plans to bring the entire world in to his clutches by acquiring command over evil spirits. Abheera, himself a powerful spirit created by Aghora, doesn't like it and confronts Aghora. An angered Aghora puts him off in a jar and throws it in to the sea.
      
      Not able to bear the harassment in school and at home, Adithya wants to go back to his village, but his parents don't agree with him. Adithya doesn't have anyone to tell his woes and runs away from home one night. While he was loitering on a river bank that night, he finds a sealed jar in the sand. Adithya gets curious to know what is inside the jar and opens it. The moment Adithya opens the jar, Abheera, the one who was put in captivity by the evil sorcerer, comes out of it. Abheera befriends Adithya and comes along to his house. 
      
      Nagaraju comes to Vishwanadham's house with the evil intention to usurp the property. Shantha is unaware of it and blindly believes her brother Nagaraju. On his advice, she starts harassing Adithya once again. Abheera notices this and in return he starts troubling Shantha and Nagaraju in many ways. Similarly in school too, Abheera does tit for tat to whosoever that annoys Adithya. Clever Adithya gains a good name in the school. Shantha and Nagaraju are afraid of Abheera and do not dare to trouble Adithya anymore. 
      
      
      On the other hand, Aghora continues to worship 'Kalabhairava' to become the mightiest and gain supremacy over the entire world. Kalabhairava asks Aghora for human-sacrifice of an intelligent boy. Aghora sets out in search of an intelligent boy. At that time Nagaraju, who suspects that some hidden power is protecting Adithya, consults Aghora in this regard. Aghora comes to know that Abheera got liberated from the jar. In his trials to re-capture Abheera , Aghora realizes that the intelligent boy Kalabhairava asked for, is none other than Adithya. Aghora attempts to kidnap and kill Adithya many times, but every time Abheera comes to Adithya's rescue and saves him.
      
      Right at that time when Aghora gets exhausted with his trials to overpower Abheera and kidnap Adithya, he comes to know that time is nearing for Abheera to leave this world and this makes him sigh with relief. He tells Abheera about it and says that the moment Abheera is out of this world, he would perform sacrifice of Adithya at Kalabhairava's altar and make his dreams come true. Immediately, Abheera approaches Gandoba Swamy, who is more powerful than Aghora and obtains a boon to remain on this earth till Adithya is out of danger from Aghora. With this boon, he comes back and after defeating Aghora, bids farewell to all and goes away.

      Elsewhere, sorcerer Aghora plans to bring the entire world in to his clutches by acquiring command over evil spirits. Abheera, himself a powerful spirit created by Aghora, doesn't like it and confronts Aghora. An angered Aghora puts him off in a jar and throws it in to the sea.
      
      Not able to bear the harassment in school and at home, Adithya wants to go back to his village, but his parents don't agree with him. Adithya doesn't have anyone to tell his woes and runs away from home one night. While he was loitering on a river bank that night, he finds a sealed jar in the sand. Adithya gets curious to know what is inside the jar and opens it. The moment Adithya opens the jar, Abheera, the one who was put in captivity by the evil sorcerer, comes out of it. Abheera befriends Adithya and comes along to his house. 
      
      Nagaraju comes to Vishwanadham's house with the evil intention to usurp the property. Shantha is unaware of it and blindly believes her brother Nagaraju. On his advice, she starts harassing Adithya once again. Abheera notices this and in return he starts troubling Shantha and Nagaraju in many ways. Similarly in school too, Abheera does tit for tat to whosoever that annoys Adithya. Clever Adithya gains a good name in the school. Shantha and Nagaraju are afraid of Abheera and do not dare to trouble Adithya anymore. 
      
      
      On the other hand, Aghora continues to worship 'Kalabhairava' to become the mightiest and gain supremacy over the entire world. Kalabhairava asks Aghora for human-sacrifice of an intelligent boy. Aghora sets out in search of an intelligent boy. At that time Nagaraju, who suspects that some hidden power is protecting Adithya, consults Aghora in this regard. Aghora comes to know that Abheera got liberated from the jar. In his trials to re-capture Abheera , Aghora realizes that the intelligent boy Kalabhairava asked for, is none other than Adithya. Aghora attempts to kidnap and kill Adithya many times, but every time Abheera comes to Adithya's rescue and saves him.
      
      Right at that time when Aghora gets exhausted with his trials to overpower Abheera and kidnap Adithya, he comes to know that time is nearing for Abheera to leave this world and this makes him sigh with relief. He tells Abheera about it and says that the moment Abheera is out of this world, he would perform sacrifice of Adithya at Kalabhairava's altar and make his dreams come true. Immediately, Abheera approaches Gandoba Swamy, who is more powerful than Aghora and obtains a boon to remain on this earth till Adithya is out of danger from Aghora. With this boon, he comes back and after defeating Aghora, bids farewell to all and goes away.

      Adithya's maternal uncle Vishwanadham, who lives in a city, is a well to do businessman. His wife is Shantha and Rangayya is their servant. The three of them live in city in a big bungalow. Vishwanadham, who is childless gets impressed by his nephew Adithya's intelligence, decides to get him educated in city. Vishwanadham convinces his sister and brings Adithya along with him to city. There is one more reason for Vishwanadham to do this. When he was facing dire financial crisis, Adithya's father Shankar Rao has helped him out with money by selling off his fields. With that money, Vishwanadham started several businesses and have become a rich man. Out of gratitude towards Shankar Rao, Vishwanadham wants to repay the favor by providing good education to Adithya and bringing him up in to an able man. Shantha doesn't like this and consults her brother Nagaraju. He tells her to harass Adithya, so that he leaves the city on his own. Shantha follows Nagaraju's advice and allots the store room in her house for Adithya to stay. She is always on the look out to harm Adithya, but gets herself affected every time.

      Adithya is a seven year old intelligent boy. He has a sister named Laxmi and his parents are Shankar Rao and Parvathi. Adithya's family lives in a village called Ramapuram. Adithya spends his time playing with friends and roaming here and there in the village.
      
      Adithya's maternal uncle Vishwanadham, who lives in a city, is a well to do businessman. His wife is Shantha and Rangayya is their servant. The three of them live in city in a big bungalow. Vishwanadham, who is childless gets impressed by his nephew Adithya's intelligence, decides to get him educated in city. Vishwanadham convinces his sister and brings Adithya along with him to city. There is one more reason for Vishwanadham to do this. When he was facing dire financial crisis, Adithya's father Shankar Rao has helped him out with money by selling off his fields. With that money, Vishwanadham started several businesses and have become a rich man. Out of gratitude towards Shankar Rao, Vishwanadham wants to repay the favor by providing good education to Adithya and bringing him up in to an able man. Shantha doesn't like this and consults her brother Nagaraju. He tells her to harass Adithya, so that he leaves the city on his own. Shantha follows Nagaraju's advice and allots the store room in her house for Adithya to stay. She is always on the look out to harm Adithya, but gets herself affected every time. 
      Adithya starts feeling lonesome in the house and then a strange parrot becomes his friend. Vishwanadham gets Adithya admitted in a good school. There in the school, is a mischievous boy Veerendra, whom everyone calls as Veeru. Since Adithya has come from a village, Veeru and his friends start teasing him all the time. In this way, Adithya faces harassment in school as well as in the house. 
      
      Elsewhere, sorcerer Aghora plans to bring the entire world in to his clutches by acquiring command over evil spirits. Abheera, himself a powerful spirit created by Aghora, doesn't like it and confronts Aghora. An angered Aghora puts him off in a jar and throws it in to the sea.
      
      Not able to bear the harassment in school and at home, Adithya wants to go back to his village, but his parents don't agree with him. Adithya doesn't have anyone to tell his woes and runs away from home one night. While he was loitering on a river bank that night, he finds a sealed jar in the sand. Adithya gets curious to know what is inside the jar and opens it. The moment Adithya opens the jar, Abheera, the one who was put in captivity by the evil sorcerer, comes out of it. Abheera befriends Adithya and comes along to his house. 
      
      Nagaraju comes to Vishwanadham's house with the evil intention to usurp the property. Shantha is unaware of it and blindly believes her brother Nagaraju. On his advice, she starts harassing Adithya once again. Abheera notices this and in return he starts troubling Shantha and Nagaraju in many ways. Similarly in school too, Abheera does tit for tat to whosoever that annoys Adithya. Clever Adithya gains a good name in the school. Shantha and Nagaraju are afraid of Abheera and do not dare to trouble Adithya anymore. 
      
      
      On the other hand, Aghora continues to worship 'Kalabhairava' to become the mightiest and gain supremacy over the entire world. Kalabhairava asks Aghora for human-sacrifice of an intelligent boy. Aghora sets out in search of an intelligent boy. At that time Nagaraju, who suspects that some hidden power is protecting Adithya, consults Aghora in this regard. Aghora comes to know that Abheera got liberated from the jar. In his trials to re-capture Abheera , Aghora realizes that the intelligent boy Kalabhairava asked for, is none other than Adithya. Aghora attempts to kidnap and kill Adithya many times, but every time Abheera comes to Adithya's rescue and saves him.
      
      Right at that time when Aghora gets exhausted with his trials to overpower Abheera and kidnap Adithya, he comes to know that time is nearing for Abheera to leave this world and this makes him sigh with relief. He tells Abheera about it and says that the moment Abheera is out of this world, he would perform sacrifice of Adithya at Kalabhairava's altar and make his dreams come true. Immediately, Abheera approaches Gandoba Swamy, who is more powerful than Aghora and obtains a boon to remain on this earth till Adithya is out of danger from Aghora. With this boon, he comes back and after defeating Aghora, bids farewell to all and goes away.

      Nagaraju comes to Vishwanadham's house with the evil intention to usurp the property. Shantha is unaware of it and blindly believes her brother Nagaraju. On his advice, she starts harassing Adithya once again. Abheera notices this and in return he starts troubling Shantha and Nagaraju in many ways. Similarly in school too, Abheera does tit for tat to whosoever that annoys Adithya. Clever Adithya gains a good name in the school. Shantha and Nagaraju are afraid of Abheera and do not dare to trouble Adithya anymore.

Kalabhairava asks Aghora for human-sacrifice of an intelligent boy. Aghora sets out in search of an intelligent boy. At that time Nagaraju, who suspects that some hidden power is protecting Adithya, consults Aghora in this regard. Aghora comes to know that Abheera got liberated from the jar. In his trials to re-capture Abheera , Aghora realizes that the intelligent boy Kalabhairava asked for, is none other than Adithya. Aghora attempts to kidnap and kill Adithya many times, but every time Abheera comes to Adithya's rescue and saves him.
      
      Right at that time when Aghora gets exhausted with his trials to overpower Abheera and kidnap Adithya, he comes to know that time is nearing for Abheera to leave this world and this makes him sigh with relief. He tells Abheera about it and says that the moment Abheera is out of this world, he would perform sacrifice of Adithya at Kalabhairava's altar and make his dreams come true. Immediately, Abheera approaches Gandoba Swamy, who is more powerful than Aghora and obtains a boon to remain on this earth till Adithya is out of danger from Aghora. With this boon, he comes back and after defeating Aghora, bids farewell to all and goes away.

      Adithya's maternal uncle Vishwanadham, who lives in a city, is a well to do businessman. His wife is Shantha and Rangayya is their servant. The three of them live in city in a big bungalow. Vishwanadham, who is childless gets impressed by his nephew Adithya's intelligence, decides to get him educated in city. Vishwanadham convinces his sister and brings Adithya along with him to city. There is one more reason for Vishwanadham to do this. When he was facing dire financial crisis, Adithya's father Shankar Rao has helped him out with money by selling off his fields. With that money, Vishwanadham started several businesses and have become a rich man. Out of gratitude towards Shankar Rao, Vishwanadham wants to repay the favor by providing good education to Adithya and bringing him up in to an able man.

Shantha follows Nagaraju's advice and allots the store room in her house for Adithya to stay. She is always on the look out to harm Adithya, but gets herself affected every time. 
      Adithya starts feeling lonesome in the house and then a strange parrot becomes his friend. Vishwanadham gets Adithya admitted in a good school. There in the school, is a mischievous boy Veerendra, whom everyone calls as Veeru. Since Adithya has come from a village, Veeru and his friends start teasing him all the time.

      Elsewhere, sorcerer Aghora plans to bring the entire world in to his clutches by acquiring command over evil spirits. Abheera, himself a powerful spirit created by Aghora, doesn't like it and confronts Aghora. An angered Aghora puts him off in a jar and throws it in to the sea.
      
      Not able to bear the harassment in school and at home, Adithya wants to go back to his village, but his parents don't agree with him. Adithya doesn't have anyone to tell his woes and runs away from home one night. While he was loitering on a river bank that night, he finds a sealed jar in the sand. Adithya gets curious to know what is inside the jar and opens it. The moment Adithya opens the jar, Abheera, the one who was put in captivity by the evil sorcerer, comes out of it.

      Adithya starts feeling lonesome in the house and then a strange parrot becomes his friend. Vishwanadham gets Adithya admitted in a good school. There in the school, is a mischievous boy Veerendra, whom everyone calls as Veeru. Since Adithya has come from a village, Veeru and his friends start teasing him all the time. In this way, Adithya faces harassment in school as well as in the house. 
      
      Elsewhere, sorcerer Aghora plans to bring the entire world in to his clutches by acquiring command over evil spirits. Abheera, himself a powerful spirit created by Aghora, doesn't like it and confronts Aghora. An angered Aghora puts him off in a jar and throws it in to the sea.
      
      Not able to bear the harassment in school and at home, Adithya wants to go back to his village, but his parents don't agree with him. Adithya doesn't have anyone to tell his woes and runs away from home one night. While he was loitering on a river bank that night, he finds a sealed jar in the sand. Adithya gets curious to know what is inside the jar and opens it. The moment Adithya opens the jar, Abheera, the one who was put in captivity by the evil sorcerer, comes out of it. Abheera befriends Adithya and comes along to his house. 
      
      Nagaraju comes to Vishwanadham's house with the evil intention to usurp the property. Shantha is unaware of it and blindly believes her brother Nagaraju. On his advice, she starts harassing Adithya once again. Abheera notices this and in return he starts troubling Shantha and Nagaraju in many ways. Similarly in school too, Abheera does tit for tat to whosoever that annoys Adithya. Clever Adithya gains a good name in the school. Shantha and Nagaraju are afraid of Abheera and do not dare to trouble Adithya anymore. 
      
      
      On the other hand, Aghora continues to worship 'Kalabhairava' to become the mightiest and gain supremacy over the entire world. Kalabhairava asks Aghora for human-sacrifice of an intelligent boy. Aghora sets out in search of an intelligent boy. At that time Nagaraju, who suspects that some hidden power is protecting Adithya, consults Aghora in this regard. Aghora comes to know that Abheera got liberated from the jar. In his trials to re-capture Abheera , Aghora realizes that the intelligent boy Kalabhairava asked for, is none other than Adithya. Aghora attempts to kidnap and kill Adithya many times, but every time Abheera comes to Adithya's rescue and saves him.
      
      Right at that time when Aghora gets exhausted with his trials to overpower Abheera and kidnap Adithya, he comes to know that time is nearing for Abheera to leave this world and this makes him sigh with relief. He tells Abheera about it and says that the moment Abheera is out of this world, he would perform sacrifice of Adithya at Kalabhairava's altar and make his dreams come true. Immediately, Abheera approaches Gandoba Swamy, who is more powerful than Aghora and obtains a boon to remain on this earth till Adithya is out of danger from Aghora. With this boon, he comes back and after defeating Aghora, bids farewell to all and goes away.

      Adithya's maternal uncle Vishwanadham, who lives in a city, is a well to do businessman. His wife is Shantha and Rangayya is their servant. The three of them live in city in a big bungalow. Vishwanadham, who is childless gets impressed by his nephew Adithya's intelligence, decides to get him educated in city. Vishwanadham convinces his sister and brings Adithya along with him to city. There is one more reason for Vishwanadham to do this. When he was facing dire financial crisis, Adithya's father Shankar Rao has helped him out with money by selling off his fields. With that money, Vishwanadham started several businesses and have become a rich man. Out of gratitude towards Shankar Rao, Vishwanadham wants to repay the favor by providing good education to Adithya and bringing him up in to an able man. Shantha doesn't like this and consults her brother Nagaraju. He tells her to harass Adithya, so that he leaves the city on his own. Shantha follows Nagaraju's advice and allots the store room in her house for Adithya to stay. She is always on the look out to harm Adithya, but gets herself affected every time. 
      Adithya starts feeling lonesome in the house and then a strange parrot becomes his friend. Vishwanadham gets Adithya admitted in a good school. There in the school, is a mischievous boy Veerendra, whom everyone calls as Veeru. Since Adithya has come from a village, Veeru and his friends start teasing him all the time. In this way, Adithya faces harassment in school as well as in the house. 
      
      Elsewhere, sorcerer Aghora plans to bring the entire world in to his clutches by acquiring command over evil spirits. Abheera, himself a powerful spirit created by Aghora, doesn't like it and confronts Aghora. An angered Aghora puts him off in a jar and throws it in to the sea.
      
      Not able to bear the harassment in school and at home, Adithya wants to go back to his village, but his parents don't agree with him. Adithya doesn't have anyone to tell his woes and runs away from home one night. While he was loitering on a river bank that night, he finds a sealed jar in the sand. Adithya gets curious to know what is inside the jar and opens it. The moment Adithya opens the jar, Abheera, the one who was put in captivity by the evil sorcerer, comes out of it. Abheera befriends Adithya and comes along to his house. 
      
      Nagaraju comes to Vishwanadham's house with the evil intention to usurp the property. Shantha is unaware of it and blindly believes her brother Nagaraju. On his advice, she starts harassing Adithya once again. Abheera notices this and in return he starts troubling Shantha and Nagaraju in many ways. Similarly in school too, Abheera does tit for tat to whosoever that annoys Adithya. Clever Adithya gains a good name in the school. Shantha and Nagaraju are afraid of Abheera and do not dare to trouble Adithya anymore. 
      
      
      On the other hand, Aghora continues to worship 'Kalabhairava' to become the mightiest and gain supremacy over the entire world. Kalabhairava asks Aghora for human-sacrifice of an intelligent boy. Aghora sets out in search of an intelligent boy. At that time Nagaraju, who suspects that some hidden power is protecting Adithya, consults Aghora in this regard. Aghora comes to know that Abheera got liberated from the jar. In his trials to re-capture Abheera , Aghora realizes that the intelligent boy Kalabhairava asked for, is none other than Adithya. Aghora attempts to kidnap and kill Adithya many times, but every time Abheera comes to Adithya's rescue and saves him.
      
      Right at that time when Aghora gets exhausted with his trials to overpower Abheera and kidnap Adithya, he comes to know that time is nearing for Abheera to leave this world and this makes him sigh with relief. He tells Abheera about it and says that the moment Abheera is out of this world, he would perform sacrifice of Adithya at Kalabhairava's altar and make his dreams come true. Immediately, Abheera approaches Gandoba Swamy, who is more powerful than Aghora and obtains a boon to remain on this earth till Adithya is out of danger from Aghora. With this boon, he comes back and after defeating Aghora, bids farewell to all and goes away.

At that time Nagaraju, who suspects that some hidden power is protecting Adithya, consults Aghora in this regard. Aghora comes to know that Abheera got liberated from the jar. In his trials to re-capture Abheera , Aghora realizes that the intelligent boy Kalabhairava asked for, is none other than Adithya. Aghora attempts to kidnap and kill Adithya many times, but every time Abheera comes to Adithya's rescue and saves him.
      
      Right at that time when Aghora gets exhausted with his trials to overpower Abheera and kidnap Adithya, he comes to know that time is nearing for Abheera to leave this world and this makes him sigh with relief. He tells Abheera about it and says that the moment Abheera is out of this world, he would perform sacrifice of Adithya at Kalabhairava's altar and make his dreams come true. Immediately, Abheera approaches Gandoba Swamy, who is more powerful than Aghora and obtains a boon to remain on this earth till Adithya is out of danger from Aghora. With this boon, he comes back and after defeating Aghora, bids farewell to all and goes away.

      Adithya's maternal uncle Vishwanadham, who lives in a city, is a well to do businessman. His wife is Shantha and Rangayya is their servant. The three of them live in city in a big bungalow. Vishwanadham, who is childless gets impressed by his nephew Adithya's intelligence, decides to get him educated in city. Vishwanadham convinces his sister and brings Adithya along with him to city. There is one more reason for Vishwanadham to do this. When he was facing dire financial crisis, Adithya's father Shankar Rao has helped him out with money by selling off his fields. With that money, Vishwanadham started several businesses and have become a rich man. Out of gratitude towards Shankar Rao, Vishwanadham wants to repay the favor by providing good education to Adithya and bringing him up in to an able man. Shantha doesn't like this and consults her brother Nagaraju. He tells her to harass Adithya, so that he leaves the city on his own. Shantha follows Nagaraju's advice and allots the store room in her house for Adithya to stay. She is always on the look out to harm Adithya, but gets herself affected every time. 
      Adithya starts feeling lonesome in the house and then a strange parrot becomes his friend. Vishwanadham gets Adithya admitted in a good school. There in the school, is a mischievous boy Veerendra, whom everyone calls as Veeru. Since Adithya has come from a village, Veeru and his friends start teasing him all the time. In this way, Adithya faces harassment in school as well as in the house. 
      
      Elsewhere, sorcerer Aghora plans to bring the entire world in to his clutches by acquiring command over evil spirits. Abheera, himself a powerful spirit created by Aghora, doesn't like it and confronts Aghora. An angered Aghora puts him off in a jar and throws it in to the sea.
      
      Not able to bear the harassment in school and at home, Adithya wants to go back to his village, but his parents don't agree with him. Adithya doesn't have anyone to tell his woes and runs away from home one night. While he was loitering on a river bank that night, he finds a sealed jar in the sand. Adithya gets curious to know what is inside the jar and opens it. The moment Adithya opens the jar, Abheera, the one who was put in captivity by the evil sorcerer, comes out of it. Abheera befriends Adithya and comes along to his house. 
      
      Nagaraju comes to Vishwanadham's house with the evil intention to usurp the property. Shantha is unaware of it and blindly believes her brother Nagaraju. On his advice, she starts harassing Adithya once again. Abheera notices this and in return he starts troubling Shantha and Nagaraju in many ways. Similarly in school too, Abheera does tit for tat to whosoever that annoys Adithya. Clever Adithya gains a good name in the school. Shantha and Nagaraju are afraid of Abheera and do not dare to trouble Adithya anymore.

      Adithya starts feeling lonesome in the house and then a strange parrot becomes his friend. Vishwanadham gets Adithya admitted in a good school. There in the school, is a mischievous boy Veerendra, whom everyone calls as Veeru. Since Adithya has come from a village, Veeru and his friends start teasing him all the time. In this way, Adithya faces harassment in school as well as in the house. 
      
      Elsewhere, sorcerer Aghora plans to bring the entire world in to his clutches by acquiring command over evil spirits. Abheera, himself a powerful spirit created by Aghora, doesn't like it and confronts Aghora. An angered Aghora puts him off in a jar and throws it in to the sea.
      
      Not able to bear the harassment in school and at home, Adithya wants to go back to his village, but his parents don't agree with him. Adithya doesn't have anyone to tell his woes and runs away from home one night. While he was loitering on a river bank that night, he finds a sealed jar in the sand. Adithya gets curious to know what is inside the jar and opens it. The moment Adithya opens the jar, Abheera, the one who was put in captivity by the evil sorcerer, comes out of it. Abheera befriends Adithya and comes along to his house. 
      
      Nagaraju comes to Vishwanadham's house with the evil intention to usurp the property. Shantha is unaware of it and blindly believes her brother Nagaraju. On his advice, she starts harassing Adithya once again. Abheera notices this and in return he starts troubling Shantha and Nagaraju in many ways. Similarly in school too, Abheera does tit for tat to whosoever that annoys Adithya. Clever Adithya gains a good name in the school. Shantha and Nagaraju are afraid of Abheera and do not dare to trouble Adithya anymore. 
      
      
      On the other hand, Aghora continues to worship 'Kalabhairava' to become the mightiest and gain supremacy over the entire world. Kalabhairava asks Aghora for human-sacrifice of an intelligent boy. Aghora sets out in search of an intelligent boy. At that time Nagaraju, who suspects that some hidden power is protecting Adithya, consults Aghora in this regard. Aghora comes to know that Abheera got liberated from the jar. In his trials to re-capture Abheera , Aghora realizes that the intelligent boy Kalabhairava asked for, is none other than Adithya. Aghora attempts to kidnap and kill Adithya many times, but every time Abheera comes to Adithya's rescue and saves him.
      
      Right at that time when Aghora gets exhausted with his trials to overpower Abheera and kidnap Adithya, he comes to know that time is nearing for Abheera to leave this world and this makes him sigh with relief. He tells Abheera about it and says that the moment Abheera is out of this world, he would perform sacrifice of Adithya at Kalabhairava's altar and make his dreams come true. Immediately, Abheera approaches Gandoba Swamy, who is more powerful than Aghora and obtains a boon to remain on this earth till Adithya is out of danger from Aghora. With this boon, he comes back and after defeating Aghora, bids farewell to all and goes away.

    - Unable to decide on whether or not to merge the outfit with the Congress, the Praja Rajyam Party today authorised its President K Chiranjeevi to take an "appropriate decision" when he meets Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi soon. The PRP, however, decided to "work together" with the Congress to achieve its objective of social justice. "Since the PRP does not have the strength of its own to realise the objective of social justice and uplift of downtrodden, we have resolved to join hands with the Congress," party Political Affairs Committee member C Ramachandraiah told newsmen after a meeting of party MLAs and senior leaders here this afternoon. He, however, did not specify if working together with the Congress meant a merger. "We have authorised our president to take an appropriate decision," Ramachandraiah said.

    - No Tie Up with BJP - Jagan @ Kadapa_telugutouch.com
    - |-
      Making it clear that there will not be any sort of tie-up or understanding with the BJP, former MP from Kadapa, YS Jaganmohan Reddy has said that the decision, once made, will not be revised at any cost.
      Addressing his followers and supporters in Pulivendula today, he said keeping his word was most important and he had resigned from the Lok Sabha and the Congress only for keeping his promise on 'Odarpu Yatra'.
      For that very promise, he said, he was ready to fight against the all-powerful Sonia Gandhi. "You all know why the bypolls are being conducted. You also know that had I continued in the Congress, the party would have thrown me out unceremoniously,'' he said.
      Jagan said that it was due to YS Rajasekhara Reddy that the Congress had formed governments at the Centre and in the state but that very party divided the family of that great leader today.
      "Now, my uncle, directed by Sonia Gandhi, has decided to contest against my mother. He says that if he does not contest the byelection Sonia will be unhappy. But has he forgotten that even if my mother gets one vote less, his brother would be unhappy?''
      Recalling the insults and criticism faced by him and those loyal to him at the hands of the Congress, he called upon his supporters to bless him and support him like they did his father YS Rajasekhara Reddy.
      Later, he interacted with Muslims at the Idgah ground on the bypass road.
      When they sought a place for constructing a mosque in Indiramma Colony, Jagan assured them that he would make serious efforts in that direction.
      He also interacted with leaders of Rajakas, disabled, Yerukalu and hamalis at the offices of their respective associations.
      He also promised to strive hard for the welfare and development of Arya Vysyas.
      DLR's cousins meet Jagan, pledge support
      Health minister and Jagan's bete noire DL Ravindra Reddy's cousins D Srinivasulu Reddy and D Gangadhar Reddy, along with Midaturu sarpanch Sudharshan Reddy and Yeturu sarpanch Chinna Reddy, and leaders from Sannupalle, Chemmulapalle, Nandipalle, Tudumula Dinne, Nagasanipalle villages in the Mydukur constituency along with their followers, came in 10 vehicles and met Jagan.
      They pledged their loyalty to Jagan and said that they would be with Jagan through thick and thin, and would not back out on their promise or lured by any.
      Thanking them for their support, Jagan said that he would stand by them always.

    - Dhoni's Prediction Over World Cup 2011_telugutouch.com
    - |-
      MS Dhoni, the India captain, has said performing under pressure has become India's strength and that will hold them in good stead for the World Cup where he admitted expectations will be high.
      
      "What we have done in the last three years is that we have changed the meaning of pressure to responsibility and we take it as an added responsibility," Dhoni said. "Cricket is the biggest sport in India and it is widely followed. Everybody wants us to do well and we take that in a positive way. We just stick to the basics, prepare well for the game and at the end of the day we know we have got the potential to do well on the field."
      
      One of the questions facing the India team, who play their first match on February 19 against Bangladesh, is how they will deal with the pressure of being tournament hosts along with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. India have failed to get past the semi-final stage in previous World Cups played on home soil. But Dhoni said he was concentrating just on the preparation. "I am ready to prepare well for the World Cup and that is what is in my hands right now."
      
      Dhoni dodged the question of whether India were favourites for the tournament by saying: "For a change we won't be considered underdogs." He stuck to what has become almost a mantra for him in his time as captain in saying "processes" would take precedence over results. "I never predict much when it comes to cricket. We believe in each of us, and the support staff members are also there to help us. We believe in doing the process, so I have no prediction about the World Cup and we will just give it our best shot."
      
      A day after England batsman Kevin Pietersen termed his side's hectic schedule leading up to the World Cup as 'ridiculous', Dhoni admitted arriving at a balanced schedule was difficult. "The biggest thing in cricket is that we do criticise a lot. When we lose a game, even I have said in the past that we play too much cricket. To get the perfect balance is a very difficult task because there is a very thin line and it is not like technology where we can be close to perfection. It is an issue that will always be raised that either it will be a cramped schedule or there is too long a gap between games."
      
      India have selected seven batsmen, four seamers, three spinners and just one wicketkeeper in their 15-man squad for the World Cup, and Dhoni said there were always players bound to miss out when you have to pick just 15 players. "We have tried to keep the best squad but you can't accommodate everyone. You can only select 15 players, so you may miss some players who are key in some areas like a left-arm spinner or maybe a legspinner. It will always be a point of discussion, but what is important is that the 15 players who are selected right now make an impact on the World Cup."
      
      Dhoni said he wasn't thinking about the disappointing loss to Bangladesh - who are India's first opponents in the 2011 tournament - in the 2007 World Cup. "I am certainly thinking about the match [against Bangladesh] positively. We may have lost in 2007, but there are plenty of positives that we can look for like the 2003 World Cup and the entire tournament we played then.
      
      "As far as the gaps between the games are concerned, we all know that it is there so what is best for us is to make a good plan to utilise it in the best possible manner. Of course, we play throughout the year, which means that in between these tense games the players will get time to relax themselves and at the same time if there are some niggles you can get over it.
      
      "It is the biggest tournament and it is the biggest thing that happens in cricket, so it is very important that you play with the best XI that your team has. You don't want to miss many players because of injuries."

    - I Was Troubled Lot WhIle Shooting - Director Shankar_telugutouch.com
    - |-
      Director N Shankar's filmography in Telugu includes Jayam Manadera, Raam, Bhadrachalam, Yamajathakudu to name a few. His films are focused on themes/concepts. He has now helmed Jai Bolo Telangana (releasing on February 4), a film based on the current statehood issue rocking Andhra Pradesh.
      
      Shankar chats about the making of the film which is close to his heart.
      
      Did you make Jai  Bolo Telangana to highlight the current political scenario?
      
      Yes, I want to focus on the current problem, the sacrifices made by people. I am depicting the struggle through the eyes of an artiste; through an art form.
      
      How long did it take you to make the film?
      
      On the 30th day ceremony of Srikanth Chari's suicide (for Telangana), I announced the project. It has taken a year to make the film right from scripting, casting, shooting to post-production and completion.
      
      What is the kind of research you did for the film?
      
      I met people involved with the movement. I saw people's enthusiasm and sacrifices. The film is shot from the people's angle. I must say I had the support of all people from all regions of the state while making the film.

    - ADMK Vs DMK - Raja As Center Of Attraction_telugutouch.com
    - |-
      On Wednesday, the DMK general council is meeting in Chennai. This is the executive political body of the party, where a decision to suspend A Raja from the party is likely to be taken.  A Raja stands virtually isolated within the party as almost all of Karunanidhi's family members are more than happy at the turn of developments in Delhi. 
      
      
      
      Except for Kanimozhi, others like Azagiri have gone to the extent of distributing sweets in the quiet of their homes. Sources say that during his recent visit to Delhi where he met the Congress leadership, the DMK chief and state chief minister M Karunanidhi was informed of the impending arrest of A Raja.  Sources say that Home Minister P Chidambaram himself explained the matter to Karunanidhi to prepare the ground for what was to come.
      
      
      
      
      
      With the state elections in Tamil Nadu to be held in April end, there is now no time to change horses mid-stream. The Pattali Makkal Katchi is aligning with the DMK, which gives them additional strength, but sources say that All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam chief J Jayalalitha is likely to use this as an election issue -- of how a Dalit is being targeted.
      
      
      
      Sources say that the Congress would now use this opportunity to ask for more seats. In fact, it may arm twist the DMK to up to 75 seats, which will be a big jump from the 36 at present.  Sources say that for the moment the two parties are together even though there is a huge trust deficit at the moment with the DMK disinclined to trust the Congress party. For the moment though they are together at least till the elections.

    - PRP Preparing Demands Lift Over Merge_telugutouch.com
    - |-
      Top leaders of Praja Rajyam Party opposing the proposal of merging the outfit with Congress at this stage but rather want their chief K Chiranjeevi to test the waters in the coming elections to urban local bodies and panchayati raj institutions before taking a final call. The dominant view that emerged at a PRP meeting today was that the time is not ripe for merging the party with Congress straightaway. 
      
      'We should strengthen our friendship right now and consider merger at a later stage', said party sources. The PRP meeting came a day after Defence Minister and senior Congress leader A K Antony had met Chiranjeevi here and discussed the political situation in the state.
      
      Party MLAs and members of the Political Affairs Committee, who met at Chiranjeevi?s residence this afternoon were understood to have suggested to PRP President that he tread cautiously and not get carried away by Congress' olive branch, like it had happened during the elections to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation in 2009. 
      
      'Let us strengthen our friendship further and assess the ground situation. Only then, we take a final call on merger,' the MLAs and PAC members said. Nine MLAs and about five PAC members attended the meeting, party sources said.
      
      Chiranjeevi, who took part in the meeting for a brief period before leaving for his assembly constituency Tirupati, is understood to have asked his party colleagues to come up with a concrete suggestion in tune with ground realities in their respective districts.

      Senior Congress leader from Andhra Pradesh G Venkat Swamy, who demanded the resignation of Sonia Gandhi as party chief, is in for serious trouble with the party high command taking a serious note of his strident criticism of her. 'We have taken note of it', party General Secretary Janardan Dwivedi said when asked about the Telangana leader's attack on Gandhi. The 82-year old former Deputy leader of the party in the Lok Sabha had demanded that Italy-born Sonia Gandhi step down as party chief and make way for an 'Indian'.
      
      In a no-holds-barred attack on Congress leadership, Venkat Swamy alleged corruption has grown and that the nation and party were suffering from various ills. Accusing Sonia Gandhi of relying on three prominent christian leaders at center who are misleading her into taking decisions dtrimental to party's interest.
      
      Congress sources said Venkat Swamy's attack needed to be seen in the light of the fact that he was soon going to be out of the Congress Working Committee which Gandhi is reconstituting. The sources said the party chief has the powers to summarily expel a CWC member if he resorted to anti-party activities. Hence, in this case even without initiating disciplinary measures the party chief may expell him, sources indicate. Talking separately, Party spokesman Manish Tewari said if Venkata Swamy had made such a statement it was 'very unfortunate' and he should not have made such remarks.

    - Raja Arrested Under 2G Scam_telugutouch.com
    - |-
      Hours after he was summoned to the CBI headquarters for questioning, former Telecom Minister A Raja was arrested for his alleged role in the 2G spectrum scam. 
      
      He will be produced in a Delhi court within the next 24 hours. (CBI on arresting A Raja) 
      
      Also arrested - two men who worked closely with Mr Raja - R K Chandolia, who served as his Personal Secretary, and Siddharth Behura, who was Telecom Secretary.(Read: Key Raja aides arrested)  
      
      The Congress quickly asserted that the arrest of the DMK leader will not impact its alliance with Mr Raja's party in Tamil Nadu; the BJP focused on describing the action against Mr Raja as "too little, too late." (Read: Raja alone 'didn't gulp crores', says BJP)
      
      And across the political board, all players agree that the arrest is an attempt by the government to rebut charges that it has not acted against corruption - a refrain of the Opposition over the last few months.  
      
      Mr Raja's arrest has been seen as a given in political circles for weeks now. He has been interrogated by the CBI four times since December, including on Monday.  
      
      His homes and offices in Tamil Nadu and Delhi have been raided; his diary and computers were seized by the CBI and are likely to be presented against him as evidence.
      
      In 2008, Mr Raja, as Telecom Minister sold valuable spectrum to telecom operators at prices that were determined in 2001; some companies that won 2G licences were new to the telecom sector, and sold some of their stake immediately for huge profits. The financial and procedural irregularities were pointed out almost immediately by the Opposition.
      
      But it was only in November 2010 that the allegations seemed poised to push Mr Raja out of the Telecom Ministry. The catalyst was a report by the government's auditor - the Comptroller and Auditor General (AG) - which declared that Mr Raja was guilty of colluding with companies he favoured to grant them mobile licences, even though they were ineligible and had in some cases lied or misrepresented information in their applications. The figure of 1.76 lakh crores floated by the CAG as the value of the scam crushed any chances of Mr Raja's survival.
      
      He was forced to resign, though he said in his defense that he had followed the policies introduced by his predecessors in the NDA government. He also said that by selling spectrum cheaply, he had delivered a country of mobile users - India's immoderate tele-density, he said, could be attributed directly to this.
      
      Kapil Sibal, who replaced Mr Raja as Telecom Minister, described the CAG report as "completely erroneous" and said the government had suffered no losses on account of 2G allocation. Today, the BJP's Arun Jaitley said the fact that Mr Raja has been arrested neutralized Mr Sibal's claim. If the 2G process had been handled correctly, he asked, why was Mr Raja arrested?
      
      Mr Jaitley also went on to target the Prime Minister, asking why he had kept silent for so long on the 2G scam when it was apparent that there were serious concerns about a senior minister in his cabinet.
      
      The government has been accused repeatedly of shielding Mr Raja to protect its alliance with the DMK. At the Centre, the DMK is a key partner in the UPA coalition. In Tamil Nadu, the Congress props up the DMK government. And both parties have announced their partnership will continue for the state elections due to be held in May.
      
      Mr Raja's arrest gives the Congress an enviable advantage now in that partnership. The Congress asserted today that Mr Raja's arrest is not a stress test for its relationship with the DMK. In Tamil Nadu, DMK sources tell NDTV that while Mr Raja's arrest could matter to voters in cities like Chennai and Madurai, rural voters have been disinterested in the 2G scam. 
      
      So far, the DMK has stood firmly by Mr Raja, stressing that it would take action against him only if he were found guilty in the 2G spectrum scam. In December, the party organized a series of rallies to project Mr Raja as a reliable and admirable leader.

      Hansika Motwani, one of the new age promising actresses of South Indian films, is looking forward to a very successful year in 2011. The actress is very confident that she will do well this year.
      
      In 2011, Hansika has already three lined up releases in Kollywood. In Engeyum Kadhal, she will be seen opposite Jayaram Ravi, Maappillai will pair her with Dhanush and she is playing the heroine of Vijay in Velayudham. Engeyum Kadhal is now in the post-production stage and the rest two films are being shot now.
      
      Hansika believes that 2011 is going to be her year in Kollywood and trade analysts also agree with her opinion. The trade analysts of Kollywood say that Hansika would rule the industry in 2011. All her three films are promising and big budget projects.
      
      The 19 year old actress says that she would hardly get any time for herself in 2011 because her kitty is full with films and is still getting offers. She thinks that it is going to be a tough challenge for her to balance her profession and family in this year. However, the bubbly actress is planning out things to balance both sides.
      
      Hansika is also planning to make her comeback in Bollywood and is in talks with a renowned filmmaker. We hope her aspirations and the calculations of trade analysts come true and the actress really shines in Kollywood in 2011!

      Deepika Padukone, who was supposed to play the female lead role in Housefull 2, the sequel to the hit comedy Housefull, has opted out of the project. Sources close to the film disclose that it was non-availability of dates that led to the decision. Now, the lanky actress has been replaced with Asin. Incidentally, Asin has been paired opposite Akshay Kumar for the first time. Sajid Khan, who directed the first part, will direct the sequel as well.
      
      It is needless to say that Asin, who recently decided not be overtly choosy and pick the best of projects which are coming her way, grabbed the opportunity with both hands.

    - VHP condemns Rahul Gandhi's anti-Hindu remark in international arena
    - |-
      Condemning Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi's alleged remark supposedly made to America's representative Mr. Timothy that Saffron Terror was more dangerous to Bharat than the Islamic Terror,  VHP's International General Secretary has expressed serious doubts about the national integrity of the 'prince' Gandhi. Criticizing Mr. Rahul Gandhi for such a remark Dr Togadia said, "We were wondering as to how suddenly from Home Minister Chidambaram & to Ex CM Digvijay Singh & a group of office bearers of Congress party as well as a few Union Ministers have started to blame Hindus as Saffron Terrorists. But with Prince Gandhi's leak on WikiLeaks explains it all. All others who blamed Hindus as Saffron Terrorists have been doing so at the instance of Prince Gandhi who shamelessly expresses his hatred about Bharat's Hindus to an American representative! Gone are the days of relishing the family image of father opening Ram Mandir locks; this prince is not only anti Hindu but also is anti-Bharat.  The ruling party's General Secretary, whom the sitting Finance Minister terms as next Prime Minister, has no respect to Bharat & Bharat's Hindu. He has no qualms even about defaming Bharat's Hindus to an official American representative! VHP condemns this most anti-Hindu & anti-Bharat behaviour of Congress General Secretary Mr. Gandhi & demands an unconditional apology from the Congress Party as well as their Prince Gandhi for humiliating, insinuating & degrading Bharat & Bharat's Hindu on an international arena. It also shows Prince's lack of diplomatic maturity as to what to say where & to whom & what not to say. Looking at Bihar & upcoming elections, Prince Gandhi celebrated Eid in Lucknow eating meat publicly on Hindu pious day Ekaadashi. That was childish enough & Cong lost Bihar. But terming Hindus of Bharat Saffron Terrorists & concluding that they are more dangerous than Islamic terrorists while even the Army head terms Pak as more dangerous, is not childish. It is an intentional act of criminal defamation of Hindus & of Bharat. It also explains who has been sponsoring a group of Congressmen to hammer Hindus, Hindu leaders, Hindu Organizations & Hindu Sadhu Saints as Saffron Terrorists every time there is a Jehadi attack on Bharat! It is not a coincidence that Mr. Digvijay Singh comes back from Azamgadh meeting a Jehadi, then supposedly calls Mumbai ATS Head just 2 hours before the heinous Jehadi attack on Mumbai & when much later the Kashi Ganga Ghaat is blasted, same Singh digs his alleged conversation with the then ATS Head. He exhibited similar behaviour even after Batla house encounter. It is time to find the real nexus of him, Azamgadh, all Jehadi blasts & his boss prince who too hammers Hindus after every Jehadi attack. "
      
      Dr Togadia further added, "If Prince Gandhi does not apologize to Bharat & Hindus for his degrading & humiliating remark then we appeal to all Hindus to abstain from voting the party of whom he is a General Secretary in any elections. We request EC to cancel his right to contest elections for hurting a religious majority. We also appeal all Hindus to democratically protest Prince Gandhi's criminally defamatory remark about Hindus & Bharat. We had heard that blood was thicker than water but we now can see that half European blood too is very dangerous to Bharat."

      "Holding the Missionaries of Charity accountable for their medical negligence and misuse of donations" STOP The Missionaries of Charity
      By Hemley Gonzalez: I worked as a volunteer in one of Mother Teresa's homes in Calcutta, India for a period of two months at the end of 2008. It was during this time that I was shocked to discover the horrific and negligent manner in which this charity operates and the direct contradiction of the public's general understanding of their work.
      
      After further investigation and research, I realized that all of the events I had witnessed amounted to nothing more than a systematic human rights violation and a financial scam of monumental and criminal proportions.
      
      Workers washing needles under tap water only to be reused again. Medicine and other vital items being store for months on end, expiring and eventually still applied sporadically to patients. Volunteers with little or no training carrying out dangerous work on patients with highly contagious cases of Tuberculosis, leprosy and other life threatening illnesses, while the workers of the charity patently refuse to accept and implement machinery and equipment that would safely automate processes and save lives.
      
      It was Mother Teresa's own admission during an interview that more than 23,000 people had died in the halls of one of the missions home; boasting at the number if you will and missing entirely the point of the enormous compilation of unnecessary deaths.
      
      Not once in its sixty year history, have the Missionaries of Charity reported the money they've taken in donations, what percentage they use for administration and where the rest has been applied and how. Since its inception, defectors of the organization and other journalists have placed the figure upwards of one billion dollars and counting. The mission currently operates 450 plus homes and maintains an average of 4,000 workers.
      
      If any other organization did this systematically for six decades, there would be arrests and criminal charges; so why the exception here?
      
      Many followers of Mother Teresa and her charity have irrationally argued in her defense while completely ignoring the ACTUAL deaths caused by the organization which in it of itself is quite troubling. While I agree that poverty is ugly, grueling and heartbreaking and it won't go away in two months or a year I have also seen how easy it is for many to swipe a credit card or send a check and in return spend hours claiming the good that's done with it but in this case, it couldn't be more inaccurate.
      
      Mother Teresa herself had also repeatedly admitted that she was not a social worker, and her followers continue to assert the same. So under what motives do they tend to the poor you may ask? The mantra of the operation rests solely on the belief that suffering and poverty are ways of loving god, something that when explained to even people of faith makes no sense at all! In short, they are there to move people to their deaths rather than actually looking for ways to fix the problem that is poverty.
      
      I have started this group and other projects to denounce the Missionaries of Charity and their work and bring worldwide attention to the acts committed by them on daily basis. I strongly believe that as humans we most help our fellow humans in need with 100% transparency and not in return of those we help having to agree with whatever spiritual path we may choose.
      
      Continuing to air these facts about Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity and organizations like hers bring attention to the fraud and manipulation that exists and helps point good people everywhere to responsible charities that work to empower men, women and children in need the world over.

    - VHP condemns attack on Police by Islamic jihadis
    - |-
      Hyderabad: In a reminder of the 26/11 attack in Mumbai, three masked gunmen opened fire at a police picket at Shah Ali Banda in the old city of Hyderabad on Friday, killing one constable and injuring another.The firing took place in a densely populated area. However, no civilian was injured since the attack was targetted at the policemen on duty.
      
      According to eye witnesses, the three masked men riding on a two-wheeler approached the police picket at about 4.30pm and fired three rounds at the policemen present. U Ramesh, a constable belonging to the 11th battalion of Andhra Pradesh Special Police (APSP), was killed.
      
      The policemen were changing shifts for lunch after finishing vigil during prayer time in the old city when the gunmen struck. According to the police, the gunmen targetted a lathi picket, implying the policemen were carrying no weapons barring lathis.
      
      The Hyderabad city police have been on high alert for the last one month following an intelligence bureau (IB) alert indicating a 26/11-type terror attack in Hyderabad.
      
      The alert also came in the backdrop of the completion of three years of bomb blast at Mecca Masjid in Hyderabad. The city police have drawn additional forces from the APSP to beef up security in the city and there has been an increase in frisking and policing on the roads of the city.
      
      Though a formal investigation is yet to begin, the police officials suspect the role of one Vikaruddin, a former activist of the banned Student Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) in the incident. Vikaruddin has been on the radar of the city police for the past three years.
      
      He is also an accused in two earlier firing incidents on police pickets.
      
      In a similar incident on December 3, 2008, Vikaruddin and his accomplices left a letter at Falaknuma police picket indicating that they would continue to target policemen. This is believed to be an attempt to take revenge on policemen who had fired at Muslim youth after the Mecca Masjid blast in 2007.
      
      Vikaruddin was also an activist of Daragah Jihad-e-Shahadat (DJS), a city-based right wing organisation which trains Muslim youths in self-defence. "We still don't know if it is Vikaruddin who had fired at the constable. But, there is a similarity to what happened today and the earlier incidents," Hyderabad police commissioner AK Khan said.
      
      Interestingly, veterans in counter intelligence are surprised at the way the terrorists managed to keep a weapon with them and move around despite increased frisking on the roads.
      
      "For the last one month, patrolling teams have been asking people to open everything they carry. No one knows how these three terrorists travelling on a two-wheeler managed to escape the police patrol with a weapon. It is a clear failure of the city police," a retired counter intelligence expert said.
      
      Sources said that the police teams have recovered a CD at the firing spot which might contain a message from the terror outfits explaining the reasons for the firing.
      
      "Last time (in 2008), we recovered a letter written in Urdu which said that the policemen would continue to be targetted. We still don't know what is there in the CD," a source said.

    - "Indian American Lobby: Hindus support Israel, the free world, against jihadi terrorism"
    - |-
      New York City, on Apr 25, 2010, in front of the Israeli Consulate, over 2000 people came together in the rain (for three hours) to protest the outrageous treatment of Israel by Obama and his administration.There were many speakers. Rabbi Aryeh Spero speaks briefly before he introduces Narain Kataria, President of Indian American Intellectuals Forum.
      
      TEXT for SPEECH:
      
      Brothers and Sisters: Shalom:
      
      I feel privileged and honored for your giving me an opportunity to speak before you. I am really thankful to the organizers of this Rally. I am living in this country for the last 40 years. America has given me freedom of religion and liberty of expression. Unlike Islamic nations, the American government does not force its citizen to accept Islam or say they would be killed or driven out of that country if they do not.
      
      Dear friends like many Jewish people I am also the victim of Islamic Jihad. I am the survivor of the Partition of India that took place in 1947. I was 17 years old when Islamists forced Hindus to divide British India into two parts in 1947 Hindu India and Islamic Pakistan.
      
      I was living in that part of India which is now called Pakistan . Since I was a Hindu, my life was made miserable by Islamic police and Islamic militia. I was hounded out by Radical Islamists. Many of my friends and colleagues were singled out, chased and brutally killed. Thousands of Hindu and Sikh girls were gang raped by fanatic Islamists. More than 10 million Hindus and Sikhs were driven out of the region that is now called Pakistan .
      
      In 1947, there were 23% Hindus living there in Pakistan . Today the Hindu population in Pakistan has been reduced to 1% in just 60 years. All the others have been ethnically cleansed.
      
      The same thing happened in Bangladesh . The Hindu population has been reduced from 35% in 1947 to 9% in 2010. More than 400,000 Hindus were driven out in 1989 from Indian ruled Kashmir . These Hindus are living as refugees in their own country.
      
      Today we Hindus are here to express our sympathy and support to Israelis who are surrounded by militant and fanatic Islamic nations armed with deadly weapons. Islamic nations want to wipe out Israel from the world map. Let me tell you, Israel is the frontier of the free World. Once we lose Israel , we lose the free world. I repeat, once we lose Israel , we lose the free world.
      
      The cowardly and politically correct media and its apologists have no idea as to what they are dealing with. It is not just Jerusalem the Islamists are claiming; they are claiming Kashmir, Chechnya, Philippines, Sudan, Nigeria, Londonistan, Parts of France, Spain, Belgium, Holland and several other countries and eventually the whole world. They want all of us to surrender. They want to subjugate all of us. They want to plant the Islamic flag in London , They want to plant the Islamic flag at in Washington . They have openly stated that they want to establish the supremacy of Allah all over the USA , in India , in Israel and everywhere else. Dear Brothers and Sisters, we have to resolutely and unitedly face this menace of terrorism.
      
      We both Hindus and Israelis are the oldest surviving civilizations. We both have been the victims of Islamic terrorism for more than a thousand year. Hence, we both are the natural allies.
      
      At the moment Israeli is under attack by radical Islamists. Israel is the only democratic country in the Middle East . It has every right to exist. We fully support Israel s right to exist as a free nation within its rightful borders.

But, Hindi entertainment channels say that they are not threatened by this as they have numbers to prove that viewership of entertainment channels had not dropped during the last season of the IPL.

      The International Cricket Council's 'Ambush Marketing Clause' has put cricketers in a spot. The erstrictions on endorsing products that are in direct conflict with teh official sponsors, range from the threat of legal action to playing bans.

But, even as the numbers are low, Imagine believes that it has tapped into a new set of audience.

    - Summer Youth Camp- Youth Shivir 2010
    - |-
      Every year Rishi Chaitanya Ashram celebrates the most vibrant event the year -- The Annual Youth Camp. This vibrant camp is open to youth from all over the world between the age group of 14yrs to 24yrs.
      An unforgettable experience, youngsters cherish it for their life time. The camp is designed especially for younsters to espouse health, well-being and conscious living. It brims them with confidence to face the challenges of this competitive world and teaches the science of perfect living. In the year 2010 also, this annual youth camp was organised with great gusto and zeal. 
      
      Unlike our homes, the day in the ashram begins at 4.30a.m. Participants here enjoy getting up early and participate in all the activities with great zeal and enthusiasm. 
      In this camp too, the day used to begin early with offering of prayers followed by the practices of yoga asanas and pranayama.These practices are not just to do with the body, in fact, it is about the total wellbeing of an individual. These help a great deal in harmonising the energy-flow, which is immensely crucial for  progress on the path of total well being. 
      Today's competitive and stressful environment requires the youth to maintain a strong equilibrium between mind and brain. Besides, such an environment creates need for improved memory and concentration. In this view, two contemporary yet powerful meditation techniques namely tratak and yog nidra were taught to the youth. 
      During the day, special workshops like candle making, painting, photography, cooking etc. were conducted for these young minds helping them explore their inner reservoir of creativity.
      Fear and phobias, anger and anxiety, guilt feelings, lack of confidence, lack of concentration, inferiority complex, negative thinking, depression and many more forcefully drive out our energies in difficult times. In this context, the sessions with Gurumaa turned out to be the most important and the highlighting feature of this camp. Besides interacting with the youth, giving them the wisdom and knowledge, Gurumaa touched upon some of the very crutial topics which are very important for the youth in day-today life. Like a mother, a mentor, a friend she gave them various opportunities to speak their mind and clarify their doubts, gently guiding them for a wholesome living.  Under the able guidance of Gurumaa, the youth practiced various techniques of meditation intended to tame their untrained mind and experience the bliss within. 
      
      Another highlighting feature of this camp was the various workshops on topics like facing exam without fear and stress, love, infatuation & sex, body language, effective communication skills and many more. Trained experts in these various fields interacted with them giving useful tips on personality development, handling different situations, and the nuts & bolts of an interview. Career counseling paved a path for all in their respective careers and helped them come out of topsy-turviness. The importance of  unconditional service (sewa) and cleanliness was also elucidated in one of the workshops, so that the youth can be an asset to the society.
      
      Dance and talent hunt were also organised that saw the youth unleash their talent. Everyone's heart was euphoric while watching the 'Talent Hunt Show' on the last evening that opened the reservoir of creativity amongst the youth. 
      The youth also saw a vivacious movie clip regarding 'power of brain' which was indeed a novel experience for them. Every day used to sum up with knowledgeable interactions and group discussions amongst the youth themselves.
      The concerted painstaking efforts of the guild in Ashram, without getting frazzled, revamped every youth and enhanced their versatility. Following a time bound schedule and the awareness for cleanliness, inculcated self decipline and taught them the key for time management in an efficient way.
      Gurumaa's magnetic charisma and her deep knowledge leaves a deep impression on the minds of these adolescents standing on the threshold of adulthood. Indeed it is the right age to be in the company of an enlightened master and seek the true purpose of life. This empowers them with skills needed to make an apprised, strong and responsible individual.Each one who attends this camp feels that they have learnt precious lessons which will be beneficial in helping them achieve success in life.

    - Health -- the Ayurvedic perspective
    - |-
      Ayurveda is one of the most ancient health sciences known to man. According to this holistic discipline, there are 3 humours in the body -- vata, pitta and kapha, or wind, fire and phlegm. If these are in balance, a person is healthy and if there is an imbalance of these, disease results.
      
      Knowing our body type is therefore one of the important keys to sound health. This means that not only do we need to modify our diet and if necessary, our lifestyle, we also need to complement this with a calm, stress-free mind. A healthy body and a peaceful mind are both prerequisites for perfect health.

    - How to know your subtle body?
    - |-
      Human body is the most beautiful and the mysterious creation of the Almighty; but more stupendous are our mystics who explored even the obscurest information about the functioning of this body, both physical and subtle, and that too without any scientific instruments. 
      It is said that the mystics gain this knowledge by using esoteric means. Through the medium of the pranic body, a mystic can enter his own physical body to study the internal organs. We have three bodies: physical, subtle and causal body. The subtle body and physical body are conjoined by pranic energy. The yogi or the mystic in this way studies gross organs as well as the intricate and complex network of nerves from head to toe. Initially, this was thought to be a mere conjecture, a gossip, but today western science is coming closer to the realization that the description of the organs, spine and chakras given by the mystics is not wrong. 
      In this video, revered mystic master Anandmurti Gurumaa reveals how a mystic, using esoteric means, is able to understand the intricacies of mind and the supreme existence and then divulges it to the whole world.

    - Tratak - Improve your concentration
    - |-
      A yoga practitioner has a well developed pineal gland. The pineal gland is a small endocrine in the vertebrate brain. It produces melatonin, a hormone that affects the modulation of wake/sleep patterns and photoperiodic (seasonal) functions. It is shaped like a tiny pinecone and is located near to the centre of the brain, between the two hemispheres, tucked in a groove where the two rounded thalamic bodies join. 
      In yogic science it is called the ajna chakra - the third eye. The true function of this mysterious gland has long been contemplated by philosophers and spiritual adepts. Ancient Greeks believed the pineal gland to be our connection to the realms of thought. Descartes called it the seat of the soul.  
      This gland is activated by light, and it controls the various biorhythms of the body. It  works  in harmony  with the hypothalamus  gland, which controls  the body's  thirst, hunger, sexual desire and the biological clock, that determines  our  aging  process. 
      When the pineal gland awakens, one may feel a pressure at the base of the brain. This pressure will often be experienced when connecting to a higher frequency.
      Eyes are said to be the extension of brain. But by the time one reaches at the age of 13 or 14, his pineal gland becomes vestigial or dormant. To overcome this degeneration, our mystics suggested the great technique called tratak.
      It is important to practice this technique on the flame of diya filled with clarified butter (desi ghee) as the flames and fumes so produced, profoundly improve the functioning of the pineal gland. 
      In this video, the revered mystic master Anandmurti Gurumaa explains the influence of this ancient meditation technique called 'tratak'.

    - Amazing Benefits of Yog Nidra
    - |-
      An ancient technique of meditation, Yoga Nidra is a multi-level relaxation method. Not only does a practitioner learn how to relax on all levels, he or she is also able to access the deeper layers of mind, where old impressions are stored. These sanskaras are both positive and negative, cultivated over lifetimes.
      
      Through Yoga Nidra, the practitioner is gently guided to release long-held negative thoughts and behaviour patterns which have dominated his life. Over a period of time, regular Yoga Nidra practice helps a person to come out of all negativity and experience a profound sense of freedom.

    - Accepting life and death willingly
    - |-
      Life and death are two sides of the same coin. They are interconnected. Yet, we do not wish to accept the inevitable -- that one day we too will die. We are strongly attached to life as we know it, not because we love life but because we have a deep fear of death, of being no more. 
      
      So in the name of religion, human beings bribe their gods and goddesses thinking that this investment will secure them a place in an illusory 'heaven'. But can it really? Life and death are the natural order of things, and only willing acceptance of both can ensure true happiness.

    - Facing past karma skillfully
    - |-
      The universal law of Karma is inexorable -- you reap whatever you sow. In other words, benevolent thoughts and actions eventually yield the fruits of a peaceful mind, purity of thought and wholesome actions. Negative mind-states give rise to hostile feelings and mental defilements like greed, hatred and lust. These  will again breed more of the same, making it a vicious cycle. 
      
      If we are not careful, negative karma keeps piling up in our karmic bank account; this will, sooner or later, yield bitter fruit whether we like it or not. Knowing this, a wise person performs actions skillfully, restraining negativity and encouraging positivism whenever he can, so that he always enjoys a bountiful harvest of good deeds.

    - A Real Master characterized
    - |-
      In this eye opening video, a distinguished woman mystic Anandmurti Gurumaa, explicitly describes how to discern the real Guru from a fake ones. The true master is synonymous of eternal knowledge, the one who has realized his own true self, and not the one, who just gives a guru mantra or who is interested in disciples' wealth. The person should not be misled by their facade. In order to know the truthfulness of a person to be chosen as Master, one must develop the wisdom to distinguish between the right and the wrong. 
      Besides, just hanging the Guru's picture at home doesn't make you a disciple. There are certain prerequisites to be called as a disciple. This requires surrender and many more... Watch this video to know more.

    - Essence of 'Japa, daana and tapa'
    - |-
      'Japa, daana and tapa' are the hallmarks of a spiritual person. It is essential to inculcate these attributes, if one is willing to walk on the path of spirituality. 'Japa' refers to chanting and being in remembrance of God. 'Tapa' refers to austerities like being truthful, stoical, waking up early in the morning and practicing yoga asana, pranayama. 'Daana' means doing charity without any feeling of pride. As per Shastras, it is mandatory to donate ten percent of our income regularly. 
      
      
      
      Shri Guru Nanak Dev reiterates, "Earn money and donate a part of it". One doesn't lose by sharing; rather sharing enriches you with compassion and love. But at the same time, one must ensure that the donation is done for a worthy cause. Watch this video where the mystic master Anandmurti Gurumaa explains the real essence of 'Japa, daana and tapa'.

    - Shine, with the Rising Sun
    - |-
      The Sun is said to be the deity of the body. Waking up at the time of brahmamuhurta is the best way to keep the body healthy and disease-free. The Sun's rays are most beneficial especially ten minutes before sunrise; hence, those who rise early get the benefit of the first rays of the sun which are also rich in Vitamin A.  Thus, practicing yoga asanas, pranayama, chanting, meditation at dawn enhances one's vitality and well being. 
      
      At the same time, it is necessary to follow spiritual practice under the able guidance of an enlightened mystic. Watch the video by the revered mystic master Anandmurti Gurumaa to know more about leading a life full of health and wisdom.

    - The real essence of religion
    - |-
      Have you ever wondered what the religion actually is? People endlessly debate on whether one should pray to a finite or an infinite God. But Gurumaaji expounds that it is your devotion that counts when you pray and not any particular God or mantra as propagated by an individual sect or religion. Moreover, it is absolutely insignificant whether you have bountiful of riches or you are a pauper, what matters is that your heart should be soaked with devotion and love when you chant the name of that Almighty. Just as sugar-candy, jaggery, sugar, all are sweet; similarly Ram, Krishna, Wahe Guru, all are the names of the Supreme consciousness, the Satchidanand.
      
      In a nutshell, Gurumaa explains that religion should be practiced as a way of life, not as a dogma. Being religious is - leading a regulated life aware fully and righteously. Watch this video by the mystic master Anandmurti Gurumaa to know the real essence of religion.

    - Introspect for the True Purpose of Life
    - |-
      We spend our whole life in beautifying this mortal body and building castles of brick and mortar. But when the prana, the life giving force leaves this body, our very own loved ones do not wait for a minute to throw us out of the house. 
      Life is short and we have miles to go before we finally sleep. 
      The wisdom therefore lies in following life as per the Guidance of Guru -- an enlightened mystic. 
      
      The video further exemplifies Sahajobai's devotion towards her master -- Sant Charandas Ji, who makes a clarion call to all to introspect for the reason why we have come into this world and how we wish to spend our life?

    - Wake up, before it is late
    - |-
      Life of a person changed completely when he heard a mother calling her child to wake up. This shook his conscience and he realized that it's time to wake up and walk on the path of spirituality; else it will be too late. The story further says that the person not only followed the path but under the able guidance of his master also attained salvation.
      
      'Arise, awake and stop not till the goal is reached', are the golden words. Can't we bring this ideology into our lives? Are we rising early in the morning and continuing the spiritual practices as advised by our master? This video is a clarion call by the great woman mystic Anandmurti Gurumaa, to abandon the sleep of ignorance and live with total awareness, so that we can come closer to our goal of attaining the knowledge of the self.

    - Value this Precious Life
    - |-
      The sole work of an infant is wailing and satisfying his gluttonous mood. But is our life any different? Even after attaining maturity, most of our time is wasted in sleeping, regretting or satiating our hunger. 
      
      Whether we eat too little or too much, we regret. The one who marries, repents and the one who does not, also repents. Our life has become a synonym of regrets. Saint Kabir says that the night is wasted in sleep and the day in eating. We do not realize that this life is extremely precious; time is constantly passing and unless we change our ways and learn to live the right way, this life too would be wasted.
      
      Are we leading a hedonistic life or progressing on our spiritual path? Are we just accumulating fragile things or are we gravely thinking about our sadhna? In this video, contemporary mystic master Anandmurti Gurumaa explains the need for a great deal of introspection to get the answers.
